Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data the Discord bot [Bot Name] ("the Bot") processes, for what purpose, and what rights you have under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

5. Data Retention

Personal data is stored only as long as necessary for the intended purpose.

Permanent storage (e.g., bans, blacklists, moderation logs) only occurs if explicitly required for functionality.
